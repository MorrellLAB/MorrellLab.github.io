Please read this short paper before coming to the discussion. Here is the link to the paper: [Carey & Papin 2018 PLoS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005871)

We will be discussing topics presented in the paper, such as immersion is the best learning tool, learning how to ask questions, etc. We will give everyone a chance to talk about their "painful" experience when they started learning to program and any tips they have. We will also be discussing a more general topic of how to approach learning to program and how to break down a complex coding problem into smaller pieces.
