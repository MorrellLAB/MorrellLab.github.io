This week we will be discussing how to get started on designing unit tests for your python code.

Read this blog post before the meeting:

[Jeff Knupp (2013). Improve Your Python: Understanding Unit Testing.](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/12/09/improve-your-python-understanding-unit-testing/)

Please also familiarize yourself with Python's documentation on unit testing. You don't need to read the entire documentation cover-to-cover, but at least be familiar with each of the main topics.
