Please install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) before the meeting. Installation should automatically include the Anaconda Navigator, which can be used to launch Jupyter Notebooks.

Please also install the [bash kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel), which can be done easily with pip. Make sure that you install it for the python version that's part of the Anaconda environment. If you have trouble with installation, we can help troubleshoot during the meeting.
