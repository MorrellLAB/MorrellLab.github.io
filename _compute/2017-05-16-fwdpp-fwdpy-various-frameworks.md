### [fwdpp](http://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpp/)/[fwdpy](http://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy/)/[fwdpy11](https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy11/) various frameworks

#### Group Discussion: Jigsaw Learning Strategy
Each person will pick one paper to read before the discussion. Groups will be divided based on the paper chosen.
#### Materials:
