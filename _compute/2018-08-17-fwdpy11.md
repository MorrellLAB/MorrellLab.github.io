## Special Does[0]Compute? Session

[Dr. Kevin Thornton](http://www.molpopgen.org/) of the University of California, Irvine has agreed to talk about fwdpy11, the Python package for forward simulation that he has been working on. This provides a means of using Python to interact with simulation input and output, with C++ code doing the heavy lifting.

This tool benefits from interaction with Kevinâ€™s venerable [libsequence package](https://github.com/molpopgen/libsequence) of DNA sequence polymorphism analysis toolkit. Kevin said libsequence is slowly moving toward a version 2.0.

## Expected preparation

To prepare for this session, please look at the following:

1. Take a look at [`scikit-allel` documentation](http://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Kevin will make comparisons to scikit-allel. You can find more information on scikit-allel and analysis of genetic variation at [this link](http://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
2. Have some awareness of Numpy, a Python extension. Please take a look at the [tutorial linked here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html).
3. Read Kevin's recent manuscript reporting improved means of "recording and processing tree sequences." This is important to efficient forward simulations. Here is the link to the [Kelleher J, Thornton K, Ashander J, and Ralph P 2018 bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/07/248500) paper.

## Suggested preparation

In addition, below are two PDFs Kevin sent that are worth looking at.

1. Overview of what libsequence 2.0 will/could look like in terms of its capabilities for analyzing variation data. The specific examples here have to do with processing the results from Jerome Kelleher's msprime. See [here for link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWmG1FOztW_C2XY8kdmSeYmhkYL_T60h/view?usp=sharing).
2. Mini-intro to fwdpy11.  The intent here is to create something like a "lab notebook" that a student may show to a PI.  "Here are the simulations that I intend and I'm showing here that they seem to work and give the expected results."  The point is that fwdpy11 integrates completely into a work flow that can use any part of Python's "data science" stack (numpy, pandas, scipy, etc.) and graphical capabilities.

The fwdpy11 intro ends with an example of using a plugin, which means something  written in C++ and developed separately from fwdpy11, but using its machinery.  Jeremy VanCleve contributed the code shown here, which is an implementation of a "snowdrift" model of social evolution.
