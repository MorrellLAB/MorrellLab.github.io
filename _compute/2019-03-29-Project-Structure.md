We will discuss the best practices for designing and following a project structure that will aid both reproducible research and project organization in general.

Please read the following paper:

Additionally, there might be a couple of slides with graphics depicting some of the HPC cluster, Github, and Dropbox directory structures that we have found to be most useful.
