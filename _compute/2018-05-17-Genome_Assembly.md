For this short discussion series, we will take a pair programming approach and work through some of the exercises in selected chapters. In pair programming, we will pair people up into groups of two on a single computer. One person will be navigating and the other will be driving.

Prior to the discussion, please skim through the chapter. It is ok if most of it does not make sense! Working through the exercises during the discussion will clarify the content presented in the book.

**All programming levels are welcome! If you are a beginner, we will pair you up with someone who has more experience programming.**
